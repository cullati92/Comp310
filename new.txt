I am trying to implement the adjacency list for a non-weighted graph and a few questions/concerns. i realize I need a linked list to store the edges and an array to store the vertices.Currently I have a (basic)Node class and a Graph class, which takes care of the addition of the edges to a particular vertex. This however does not explicitly define a linked list for the edges. I want to do a DFS and BFS and was wondering how should I go about it? Do I need to changed the code that I already have to incorporate these methods or now. Help will be appreciated.
